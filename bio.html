	<img src="brigidhoran_grad_dog.jpg" alt="Brigid Horan and Clover the Dog. A dynamic duo. Brigid is looking very trustworthy and intelligent with a grad cap and a dog."/>

	<p>Brigid is an avid fan of Parks and Rec and a huge dog lover. She is from NJ and therefore loves bagels and the Jersey shore. She has four (4) plants and one (1) dog. She likes running and painting. She is undeclared for a major and taking suggestions. Email her with ideas, or job offers, since obviously being undecided is a very, very desirable trait in a candidate.</p>
