# brigidhoran.github.io

Correctly Implemented:	In this assignment, I created 3 html files for index, resume, and bio. I used github to make the user page, brigidhoran.github.io, and added all the files (index.html, resume.html, bio.html as well as my pictures, readme and pdf) to my github repository. This way, all links are local since I have everything I'm linking to within the same place. I created a public_html folder containing an index.html file to redirect any request to me on the tufts server at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~bhoran01/ to my git page, and corrected the permissions of my website so it is available. All code should pass the W3 html validator and the css style checker, and once I got past an initial problem where I was having trouble committing to git, I committed often.

Incorrectly Implemented:
As far as I know everything is fine
